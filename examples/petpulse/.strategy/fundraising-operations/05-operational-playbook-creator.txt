                         1. COMPANY FOUNDATION
================================================================================

    MISSION:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Empower pet parents to keep their furry family members healthy and happy
    through continuous, AI-powered health monitoring that catches issues
    before they become emergencies.

    VISION:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Become the trusted health companion for every pet family worldwide - the
    platform that veterinarians recommend and pet parents love, reducing
    preventable pet health crises by 50% within a decade.

    CORE VALUES:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. PET PARENTS FIRST
       "We talk to 10 pet parents every week. Every feature starts with
       their pain points, not our assumptions."

    2. SCIENCE-BACKED, VET-VALIDATED
       "No feature ships without veterinary review. We earn trust through
       clinical accuracy, not marketing claims."

    3. MOVE FAST, CARE DEEPLY
       "Ship in days, not months. But never ship something that could
       harm a pet or mislead a parent."

    4. OWN IT
       "No 'that's not my job.' If you see a problem, you own fixing it
       until someone else explicitly takes over."

    5. CELEBRATE THE PACK
       "We win as a team. Share credit generously, give feedback kindly,
       and lift each other up."
