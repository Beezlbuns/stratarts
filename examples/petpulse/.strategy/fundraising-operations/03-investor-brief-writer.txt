    THE PROBLEM
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Pet parents spend $136B annually on pet care, yet preventable health
    issues cost $4,800 per emergency vet visit. 67% of pet health conditions
    are detected too late for optimal treatment. No consumer solution provides
    continuous, AI-powered health monitoring for pets.

    THE SOLUTION
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    PetPulse is a smart health monitoring collar + subscription app that
    provides 24/7 health tracking, AI-powered anomaly detection, and
    veterinarian-validated insights. We catch health issues 3-4 weeks before
    visible symptoms, reducing emergency costs by 40%.

    THE MARKET
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    TAM: $260B global pet wellness market (2027)
    SAM: $8.5B pet health technology segment
    SOM: $850M accessible market in Year 1

    Pet ownership up 15% post-COVID. Premium pet spending growing 12% annually.
    Pet parents increasingly treat pets as family members ("pet humanization").

    THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. HARDWARE + SUBSCRIPTION MOAT: Proprietary collar + ML models = high
       switching costs. FitBark/Whistle are activity-only (no health).

    2. VETERINARY VALIDATION: Partnerships with 3 vet clinics for algorithm
       training. First consumer pet device with clinical validation.

    3. DATA NETWORK EFFECTS: 7,300 pets generating training data. Each new
       user improves accuracy for all users.

    THE ASK
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Raising: $5M Series A at $20M post-money valuation (25% dilution)

    Use of Funds:
    +-- Engineering (40%): Expand ML team, next-gen collar
    +-- Sales & Marketing (35%): Scale to 16K subscribers
    +-- Operations (15%): Manufacturing partnerships
    +-- G&A (10%): Infrastructure, compliance

    Trigger for Series B: $2M ARR, 8,000 subscribers, 88% D30 retention

                         COLD EMAIL TEMPLATE
================================================================================

    SUBJECT: PetPulse - $360K ARR, 85% D30 Retention (Pet Health AI)

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi [First Name],

    I'm Sarah, CEO of PetPulse. We're building the health monitoring platform
    for pet parents - think Oura Ring for dogs and cats.

    I'm reaching out because [Fund Name]'s investments in [Portfolio Company]
    show deep expertise in [consumer hardware / pet tech / health AI] -
    exactly where we're building.

    TRACTION (18 months post-launch):
    +-- $360K ARR, growing 18% MoM
    +-- 7,300 active users
    +-- 85% D30 retention (industry: 40%)
    +-- 4.8:1 LTV:CAC ($892 LTV, $185 CAC)

    THE OPPORTUNITY:
    Pet wellness is a $260B market by 2027. Pet parents spend $136B annually
    but lack tools for proactive health monitoring. We're the first
    consumer device with veterinarian-validated AI for pet health.

    We're raising $5M Series A to scale to 16K subscribers and hit $2M ARR.
    Our 18-month runway lets us stay disciplined on unit economics.

    Would you have 20 minutes next week for an intro call? I'd love to share
    our deck and hear your perspective on the pet tech space.

    Best,
    Sarah Mitchell
    CEO, PetPulse
    sarah@petpulse.com | petpulse.com

    P.S. Our early investors include [Seed Lead] who can share more context.
