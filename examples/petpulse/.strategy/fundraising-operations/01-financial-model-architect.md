## Unit Economics

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**LTV Calculation:**
```
LTV = (ARPU × Gross Margin × Average Lifespan)

Conservative:
LTV = ($28 × 0.72 × 18 months) + ($199 × 0.47 × 1)
LTV = $363 + $94 = $457

Target (with improvements):
LTV = ($27 × 0.72 × 24 months) + ($189 × 0.52 × 1)
LTV = $466 + $98 = $564
```

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

| Year | Marketing Spend | New Customers | CAC | Target CAC |
|------|-----------------|---------------|-----|------------|
| Y1 | $800K | 10,000 | $80 | <$100 |
| Y2 | $2.5M | 35,000 | $71 | <$85 |
| Y3 | $4.5M | 70,000 | $64 | <$75 |
| Y4 | $7.5M | 120,000 | $63 | <$70 |
| Y5 | $10M | 180,000 | $56 | <$65 |

### LTV:CAC Ratio

| Year | LTV | CAC | LTV:CAC | Payback (months) |
|------|-----|-----|---------|------------------|
| Y1 | $457 | $80 | 5.7:1 | 4 |
| Y2 | $490 | $71 | 6.9:1 | 3.5 |

| Y4 | $540 | $63 | 8.6:1 | 3 |
| Y5 | $564 | $56 | 10.1:1 | 2.5 |
