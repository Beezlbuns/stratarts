    --> Pet parents spend $136B annually, yet preventable issues cost $4,800/emergency

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    --> Smart collar with 5 sensors: heart rate, temp, activity, sleep, respiration
    --> AI detects anomalies 3-4 weeks before visible symptoms

================================================================================
                       COMMON INVESTOR QUESTIONS
================================================================================

    Q: Why can't FitBark or Whistle add health features?
    A: They lack the sensor hardware and 7,300+ pet training dataset.
       Our vet-validated ML models took 2 years to develop.

    Q: What's the hardware margin story?
    A: Hardware is 35% margin today, improves to 45% at scale.
       Real margin is in the subscription (72% blended margin).

    Q: How defensible is the AI moat?
    A: Network effects: each new pet improves accuracy for all.
       Plus 4 patents pending on sensor fusion algorithms.

    Q: What's the path to profitability?
    A: Break-even at Month 36 / $4M ARR.
       Rule of 40 score: 57 (Growth 86% + Margin -29%).

    Q: Why Series A now vs. more traction?
    A: Proven PMF (85% retention). Capital needed to capture market
       before copycats emerge. 18-month runway gives flexibility.
