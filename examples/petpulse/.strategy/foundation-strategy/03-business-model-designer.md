## Unit Economics

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Assumptions:**
- Average subscription tenure: 36 months
- Monthly churn: 2.5%
- Monthly ARPU: $25 (subscription) + $4.50 (telehealth) = $29.50

**LTV Calculation:**
```
LTV = ARPU × Gross Margin × (1 / Churn Rate)
LTV = $29.50 × 75% × (1 / 2.5%)
LTV = $29.50 × 75% × 40
LTV = $885
```

**Including Hardware:**
```
Total LTV = $885 + $82 (hardware margin) = $967
```

---

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Channel Mix (Year 2):**

| Channel | % Spend | CAC | Blended |
|---------|---------|-----|---------|
| Paid Social | 40% | $120 | $48 |
| Influencer | 25% | $80 | $20 |
| SEO/Content | 20% | $40 | $8 |
| Referral | 15% | $30 | $4.50 |
| **Blended** | 100% | | **$80.50** |

**Target CAC:** $80-100

---

### LTV:CAC Ratio

```
LTV:CAC = $967 / $80.50 = 12.0:1
```

**Assessment:** Excellent unit economics. Target is 3:1; PetPulse projects 12:1.

**Payback Period:**
```
Payback = CAC / (Monthly ARPU × Gross Margin)
Payback = $80.50 / ($29.50 × 75%)
Payback = $80.50 / $22.13
Payback = 3.6 months
```

## Pricing Strategy

### Value-Based Pricing Rationale

**Customer Value Created:**
- Avoided emergency vet visit: $800-1,500 (1x/year)
- Time saved vs. vet office: 4 hours × $50/hour = $200
- Peace of mind: Priceless (but worth ~$100/year to survey respondents)
- **Total Annual Value:** $1,100-1,800

**Price Capture Rate:** $300 / $1,100 = 27% of value created

**Assessment:** Room for price increases as brand strengthens.

---

### Pricing Tiers

| Tier | Monthly | Annual | Features |
|------|---------|--------|----------|
| Free | $0 | $0 | Basic tracking, 7-day history |
| Essential | $15 | $150 | Full monitoring, no telehealth |
| Premium | $25 | $250 | Full monitoring + 1 consult/mo |
| Family | $40 | $400 | Premium for 3 pets |

**Projected Mix:** Free (35%), Essential (15%), Premium (40%), Family (10%)

## Business Model Risks

### Risk 1: Hardware Dependency

- **Mitigation:** Competitive payouts, flexible scheduling, exclusive partnerships

### Risk 3: Subscription Fatigue
- **Risk:** Consumers resist another subscription
- **Mitigation:** Clear value demonstration, free tier, annual discount

### Risk 4: Competitive Pressure
- **Risk:** Whistle/Mars adds telehealth, price war
- **Mitigation:** Focus on health outcomes, build data moat, community
