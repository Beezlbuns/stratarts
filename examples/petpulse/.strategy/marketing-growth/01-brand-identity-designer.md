## Brand Story

### Origin Story

"PetPulse was born from a moment every pet parent knows: watching your dog act 'a little off' and wondering if you should worry.

Our founder's dog, Luna, was lethargic for days before a vet visit finally revealed an infection. 'If only I had known sooner,' she thought. That regret—shared by millions of pet parents—sparked an idea.

What if you could know? What if every subtle change was tracked, every concern addressed immediately? What if 'I think something's wrong' could instantly become 'here's what's happening'?

PetPulse makes that possible. We combine continuous health monitoring with instant veterinary access—because your pet can't tell you when something's wrong, but their vitals can."

### Brand Manifesto

**"For Those Who Love Like Family"**

You don't have a pet. You have a family member who happens to have four legs.

You know their favorite spot on the couch. Their excited bark when you come home. The way they sense when you need comfort.

You also know the worry. The 'is that normal?' thoughts. The late-night Google searches. The anxiety of waiting for vet appointments.

We built PetPulse because we're pet parents too. Because we believe you deserve to know—not guess, not worry, but truly know—that your pet is okay.

This is technology with a heart. Data that cares. Innovation in service of the oldest bond in the world.

Welcome to peace of mind.
