## Valuation Framework

### Seed Valuation Justification

**Comparable Transactions:**
| Company | Stage | Valuation | Revenue | Multiple |
|---------|-------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Whistle (acquired) | Early | $117M | $10M | 12x |
| Fi | Series B | $150M | ~$20M | 7.5x |
| Furbo | Series A | $30M | ~$5M | 6x |
| PetPulse | Seed | $6M | Pre-rev | - |

**Valuation Factors:**

**Target: $6M pre-money** (reasonable for strong seed with traction)

### Series A Valuation Justification

- Growth rate premium (200%+ YoY)

## Negotiation Strategy

### Term Sheet Priorities

| Term | Priority | Target | Acceptable |
|------|----------|--------|------------|
| Valuation | High | $6M pre | $5M pre |
| Board seats | High | 1 investor, 2 founders | 2 investors |
| Pro-rata rights | Medium | Yes | Yes |
| Liquidation pref | Medium | 1x non-participating | 1x participating |
| Option pool | Medium | 10% post | 15% post |
| Anti-dilution | Low | Broad-based weighted avg | - |

### Negotiation Tactics

**Do:**
- Create competitive tension (multiple term sheets)
- Focus on partnership fit, not just terms
- Negotiate option pool sizing carefully
- Get founder-friendly board structure
- Understand all terms before signing

**Don't:**
- Accept first term sheet without comparison
- Over-optimize on valuation alone
- Ignore investor reputation
- Rush due diligence
- Burn bridges with rejected investors

### Red Flags to Avoid

| Red Flag | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| >2x liquidation preference | Misaligned incentives |
| Full ratchet anti-dilution | Punitive in down rounds |
| Excessive board control | Limits founder autonomy |
| Participating preferred | Double-dipping on returns |
| Aggressive option pool | Excessive dilution |
