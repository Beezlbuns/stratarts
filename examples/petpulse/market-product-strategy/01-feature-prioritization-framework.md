## RICE Scoring Framework

### Scoring Criteria

**Reach (R):** How many users will this feature affect in the next quarter?
- Score: Number of users (out of projected 10,000 Y1 users)

**Impact (I):** How much will this feature move the needle on our key metric (conversion)?
- 3 = Massive impact
- 2 = High impact
- 1 = Medium impact
- 0.5 = Low impact
- 0.25 = Minimal impact

**Confidence (C):** How confident are we in reach and impact estimates?
- 100% = High confidence (have data)
- 80% = Medium confidence (strong signals)
- 50% = Low confidence (intuition only)

**Effort (E):** Person-months required to build
- Engineering + design + QA

**RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**

## Summary

### MVP Feature Set

1. **Heart rate monitoring** - Core differentiator
2. **Temperature monitoring** - Core differentiator
3. **AI health alerts** - Core differentiator
4. **Vet telehealth** - Core differentiator
5. **Activity tracking** - User expectation
6. **Health history dashboard** - User expectation
7. **Health baseline learning** - Enables accurate alerts

### Roadmap Summary

| Phase | Timeline | Features | Effort |
|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| MVP | Months 1-6 | 7 core features | 45 PM |
| V1.1 | Months 7-9 | +3 features | 6 PM |
| V1.2 | Months 10-12 | +3 features | 8 PM |
| Future | Year 2+ | Backlog | TBD |

### Key Decisions

1. **Prioritize health over GPS** - Our differentiator is health, not location
2. **Delay social features** - Not core value, low ROI
3. **API access for tech segment** - Later phase, not MVP
4. **Focus on dogs first** - Cats require different form factor

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run:** `go-to-market-planner` - Plan launch strategy for MVP
2. **Run:** `pricing-strategy-architect` - Optimize pricing based on feature set
3. **Run:** `strategic-roadmap-builder` - Build 18-month OKR roadmap
