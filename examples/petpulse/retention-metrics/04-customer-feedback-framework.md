## Net Promoter Score (NPS) Program

### NPS Overview

**NPS Question:** "How likely are you to recommend PetPulse to a friend or fellow pet parent? (0-10)"

**Score Calculation:**
```
NPS = % Promoters (9-10) - % Detractors (0-6)

Example:
62% Promoters - 10% Detractors = 52 NPS
```

### NPS Benchmarks

| Score Range | Rating | Target |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| 70+ | World-class | Long-term |
| 50-69 | Excellent | Year 1 |
| 30-49 | Good | Baseline |
| 0-29 | Needs improvement | Alert |
| Negative | Critical | Crisis |
